## Dependencies
This section describes the application's dependencies on other applications within {organization_name}'s technology landscape. It catalogs both upstream and downstream systems, detailing the nature of each integration and the types of data exchanged. Understanding these inter-app relationships is crucial for assessing integration complexity, identifying potential points of failure, and planning coordinated updates.

| Application Name | Interface Type |
|------------------|----------------|
| {dependency_1} | {interface_type_1} |
| {dependency_2} | {interface_type_2} |
| {dependency_3} | {interface_type_3} |
| {dependency_4} | {interface_type_4} |

## Context Model
This section introduces the System Context Diagram, which defines the boundaries of the application within {organization_name}'s broader technology landscape. It identifies all external actors—such as end users, other systems, and third-party services—and illustrates the primary data exchanges between them. By presenting these relationships in a single, high-level view, stakeholders gain a clear understanding of where the application sits and how it interacts with its environment.

## Footprint
This section outlines the application's footprint by detailing its licensing requirements and total cost of ownership. It enumerates license types, quantities, renewal schedules, and associated support fees, alongside infrastructure and operational expense estimates.

| Application Information | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| Application TCO | {application_tco} |
| Application CapEx | {application_capex} |
| Application OpEx | {application_opex} |
| Application Vendor | {application_vendor} |
| Application License | {license_name} |
| Application License Start Date | {license_start_date} |
| Application License End Date | {license_end_date} |
| Application License Units | {license_units} |
| Application License Units Utilised | {license_units_used} |
| Application License Usage | {license_status} |
